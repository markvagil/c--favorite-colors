# Overview

* This is my C++ program which is called the "Favorite Color Tracker" which you can use add or remove your favorite colors from the list (vector), or really any strings for that matter, and save it to a text file, and even read that file back into the list (vector). So for example, if your list is "Blue, Green, Red" and you save the list, then read it back, the list (vector) will then be "Blue, Green, Red, Blue, Green, Red."

* The purpose of completing this project was to learn C++ and understand how it works and get better at using it to create simple projects just like this one.

* This program uses many C++ functionalities such as variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and vectors. This program is also able to read and write to a file.

# Video Demonstration

* This is a brief video that I recorded which shows how to use the program and how it works behind the scenes in terms of the code and structure.

# Development Environment

* The tool that I used to develop the software was a website called [Replit.com](https://replit.com/~). This is a new IDE that I used to create this project and I loved working with it. It works just like any desktop based IDE and has a lot of the same functionality so it was a very fun experience and I would make future projects on this website.
* The programming language that I used to complete this project is C++20. It is a very interesting and unique language which is based around object oriented programming and I enjoyed using it very much.
* Github is the online repository I used to store this project.

# Useful Websites

These are some of the websites that were useful to me in making this project:
* [W3 Schools C++ Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/CPP/default.asp) - this is the tutorial which helped me learn how to write the code and the basic structures
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - this is what helped me solve weird problems and do something that wasn't explained in the tutorial
* [Geeks For Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) - this helped me learn how to use vectors
* [C Plus Plus](https://www.cplusplus.com/) - this was also a very useful website
